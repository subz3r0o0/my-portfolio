            <h2>Project Concept</h2>
            <p>The idea for this project stemmed from my desire to create a visually dynamic and interactive water feature using Arduino technology. Initially torn between a waterfall and an RC car project, I chose the waterfall due to its greater potential for creativity and the opportunity to work with water.</p>
            
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>The project was broken down into manageable steps, starting with understanding the functionality of the water pump (R385 model) and the MOS module (IRF520). After successfully wiring and testing the water pump, I integrated an ultrasonic sensor that controlled the water flow based on the proximity of an object. To enhance the user experience, I incorporated a traffic light system to signal when the water flow would start.</p>
            
            <h2>Technical Overview</h2>
            <p>Through this project, I balanced the challenge of constructing the circuit and writing the code. Troubleshooting the circuit presented the most difficulty, but I successfully completed a working waterfall that operated based on object proximity and was enhanced with a countdown feature using LEDs.</p>
